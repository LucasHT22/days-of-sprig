# Introduction

Sprig is a game console where every user is a creator. It can only be obtained by building a tile-based game in the web-based game editor and shipping it in the community gallery. It's made by Hack Club.

## Take a look at the tutorial

### Comments

According to MDN Web Docs, comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.

Long comments:
```js
/*

*/
```

Short comments:
```js
//
```
> What is MDN Web Docs?
> There are docs documenting various functions in different languages. We'll be using their definitions in many topics.


> Why comment?
> Making comments is important so that in the future you and others understand your code.

### Const

[](https://cloud-98w5ievfk-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0frame_1.jpg)

According to MDN Web Docs, the const declaration declares local variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment using the assignment operator (=), there is a way for this value to be changed, but let's stop here for now.

> What is a variable?
> It is something that represents data. Like A represents "Sprig is fun".

### map``

map`` is a graphical interface for assembling maps (exclusive to Sprig), in it we place Sprites, in bitmaps, which we will see later.

> What is a Sprite?
> Not the soda! haha. Sprites are images used in games to represent objects.

### setLegend()

setLegend() is a premade function that stores your Sprites.

Here's the structure:

```js
setLegend(
  [ variable, bitmap`.` ]); // the variable is the one you declared in Const
```

> What is a function?
> According to MDN Web Docs, a function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

### bitmap``

bitmap`` is a graphical interface for assembling Sprites (exclusive to Sprig), it's a 16x16 tile-based Sprite.

> What is a tile-based Sprite?
> Are Sprites made of squares, hexagons or rectangles

According to MDN Web Docs, let declares re-assignable, block-scoped local variables, optionally initializing each to a value.
